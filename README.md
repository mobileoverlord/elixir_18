# Elixir18

This project is an example build for Elixir 1.8.0-dev. It is being used to test the PR https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/8443/files

To run this project, you will need to compile elixir from this PR. You will also need to install `nerves_bootstrap` by checking out
https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_bootstrap/tree/elixir-18
and running `mix install`

## Targets

Nerves applications produce images for hardware targets based on the
`MIX_TARGET` environment variable. If `MIX_TARGET` is unset, `mix` builds an
image that runs on the host (e.g., your laptop). This is useful for executing
logic tests, running utilities, and debugging. Other targets are represented by
a short name like `rpi3` that maps to a Nerves system image for that platform.
All of this logic is in the generated `mix.exs` and may be customized. For more
information about targets see:

https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content

## Getting Started

To start your Nerves app:
  * `export MIX_TARGET=my_target` or prefix every command with
    `MIX_TARGET=my_target`. For example, `MIX_TARGET=rpi3`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
